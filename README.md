# Clock without RTC module based on an Arduino

This is my first Arduino based project through which I learned a bit about the micro-controller. I purchased an Arduino kit and it came with a few sensors and some instructions. Out of curiosity I decided to make a clock with the LCD display that came included and found out that a Real Time Clock (RTC) module would be the easiest way to make one. Since my kit lacked said module, I decided to make the clock without one and also decided to include real time temperature and humidity data using the DHT11 sensor.

**Required Parts:**
* Arduino Uno 
* Breadbord
* LCD 16x2
* 3x pushbuttons
* Jumper cables
* 50k Potentiometer
* DHT 11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
